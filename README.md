# todo-app

The TODO project using Vue2 and Vuex was be a simple application that implements the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for a list of tasks with validation. The project will be built using the Vue.js framework and the Vuex state management library. The Vuex store will store the state of the application, including the list of tasks and any other relevant information. The user will be able to add new tasks, mark existing tasks as complete, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.The application will have a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing the user to easily perform all the necessary CRUD operations while also ensuring that the data entered is valid.
